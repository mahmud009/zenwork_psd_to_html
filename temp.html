            <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
                Designate a workspace at home for those late nights. This can be anywhere you have access to
                a
                flat
                surface and adequate lighting that allows you to concentrate — a desk, your kitchen table, a
                reading
                chair, just not your bed! This helps your mind and body understand when you’re in working
                mode
                and
                allows you to more effectively transition to “home” mode when you’re done.

            <h3>Stay Focused
                on Work</h3>
            <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
                In addition to your workload, you probably also have a to-do list that includes going grocery
                shopping, washing the dishes, and doing laundry. And it’s probably making you sweat just thinking
                about how you’ll manage to get everything done. My advice: Compartmentalize. Prioritize the urgent
                to-do (your work project), and let yourself off the hook with the others.

            <h3>Quit Multitasking</h3>
            <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
                On a similar note, don’t try to fit in the fun stuff on an evening or weekend when you need to be
                working. If you’re trying to squeeze in writing a blog post during the commercial breaks of American
                Idol, chances are it won’t be that good, and you’ll end up spending more time on revising it later.
                Either commit to taking a break from work for some fun or getting everything done now so that you
                can enjoy yourself fully later.
                </br>

                Working after hours is one of those unfortunate facts of life, but you can create rituals and
                boundaries that enable you to do it in a healthy, productive way. Furthermore, establishing
                these
                boundaries will help you assert yourself anytime you’re being asked to do something you’re
                uncomfortable with — at work or elsewhere.
